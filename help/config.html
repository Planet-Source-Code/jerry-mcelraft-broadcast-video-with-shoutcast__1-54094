<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">Configuration Setup</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">The first step to using nsvgui is getting
the config setup. This lets the program know how you want it to operate. It
starts off with a brief description of the program and a link to the homepage
incase you ever need to get back to the site. Only two tabs you need to worry
about, Shoutcast and Encoding.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><u>Shoutcast tab</u><br><img border="0" src="images/config01.gif" width="318" height="238"></font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Host IP</b>: This is the IP of where to
stream to. If you have no idea what a shoutcast server is, then you need to
check out <a href="http://www.shoutcast.com">http://www.shoutcast.com</a>. You
can't run a stream without one. Enter the IP in here, without the port. If you
are running the server on the same pc as this program, then use localhost or
127.0.0.1 as the IP.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Port</b>: This specifies what port to
connect to the shoutcast server with. Even though the source is suppose to use
the baseport + 1, you don't do that with this. The default port is 8000, check
your shoutcast config if you are unsure on what yours is.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Password</b>: This is the password that
the shoutcast server requires. Check your shoutcast config if you are unsure of
what it is. I wouldn't recommend using the default &quot;changeme&quot; for
security reasons (it says changeme for a reason).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana"><u>Encoding tab</u><br><img border="0" src="images/config02.gif" width="318" height="238"><br>(If
you did all your encoding ahead of time, you can skip this)</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Type</b>: This is where you choose the
codecs you want. You need to have the codecs installed on your pc to use them.
You can get VP3 <a href="http://www.theora.org/~mauricio/VP3_VFW_Win.exe">here</a>
and get VP6 <a href="http://on2.com/vp6.php3">here</a>. VP6 produces higher
quality files, so it is recommended over VP3.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Bitrate</b>: This is where you set the
bitrate of the stream. The math for figuring this out is upstream/watchers=bitrate.
You can find out your upstream from <a href="http://pcpitstop.com/internet/BandwidthUp.asp">here</a>.
A typical cable/DSL upstream speed is 256kbps, so if you want 4 listeners,
that'd be 256/4 which would be 64kbps. If you want more watchers with higher
quality, you can always look into professional servers.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Force framerate</b> (experts only): Use
this if nsvenc has a problem detecting the framerate of a file. This happens a
lot with XVID movies.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Custom profiles</b> (experts only): Use
this if you would like to configure the codecs before the encode.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Delete encoded files</b>: Use this if
you want the encoded files to be deleted after they are used in the stream. If
you keep this off, the program will use previously encoded files if you insert
the source files into future playlists, cutting the time to get the stream
running down dramaticly.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana"><b>Save encoded files to</b>: This is the
folder that the files will be encoded to. If you don't care where they go, leave
at default and nsvgui will handle it.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">That's it, you're done!<br><a href="index.html">Go back to index</a></font></p>
