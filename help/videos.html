<p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="5">Selecting Videos</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Now that we have our config and header set
up, we can now get to making our stream.</font></p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="images/videos01.gif" width="479" height="361"></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">1.) On the Source Files side of the window,
select the drive and folder containing a file you want to add.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">2.) Select it in the list and press
&gt;&gt; to add it. You can also use the &gt;&gt; ALL to import that entire
folder into the playlist. <font size="1"><i>(NOTE: If you import nsv files, they
must be encoded with the same settings or stream won't work correctly. If you
import both nsv and other formats, you probably would be better off enabling
custom profiles and selecting the same settings that the nsvs were encoded with)</i></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">3.) Make final adjustments to the playlist.
This is done by selecting an entry and using the arrows on the side to move it
around. X will remove a file from the list. If you don't like the list at all,
you can use the Clear Playlist button at the bottom to erase it. You can check
the Random option if you want to add some variety.<font size="1"><i> (NOTE:
Checking random won't show any difference in the playlist at this time, but the
stream will play randomly)</i></font></font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Optional) You can enter a name for the
playlist and click the Save Playlist button if you'd like to use this playlist
in the future. It will create a m3u in the folder that is selected to the left.
This playlist can also be played back in Winamp.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">4.) Hit stream to start the streaming
process. The program will start a DOS window, which may be minimized. In this
DOS window, you can check on encoding and other steps. When it says &quot;<i>Opening
file 'xxx/playlist.nsv' ...Success,</i>&quot; that means it is finally
streaming.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana">Optional) After you create the playlist,
you can create an addition to it by going through the same steps again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Verdana">Success! You're streaming!<br><a href="index.html">Go
back to index</a></font></p>
